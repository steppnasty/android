Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo] (http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the aospX trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/SyNtheticNightmar3/android.git -b ics-devel

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

To build:

    . build/envsetup.sh
    lunch aospx_glacier-userdebug
    make -j4 aospx
